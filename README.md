
#  An adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for Breast Cancer Classification



The anfis network is a superset of all feedforward neural networks using either a simple back propagation gradient descent learning rule, or a hybrid learning rule that uses back propagation and a least-squares method. This project presents a supervised learning application for breast cancer classification.
