#  An adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for Breast Cancer Classification



## Project Overview

This project presents a supervised learning application for breast cancer classification using an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems on a nine attribute dataset. A series of five experiments were carried out on the dataset to approximate an adequate condition for classification.
